# Markets for Electricity Project
## By Shawn Leavor

The goal of this project was to discover if there was an environmental Kuznets Curve.

The following file is a Jupyter Notebook file that opens all the different World Bank data files, processes the data to be by country and year, and then looks for evidence of the Kuznets curve.

There are many graphs that show a trend of a Kuznets curve for 23 countries and various stages of development around the world. There are also many regressions, some that are more valuable than others, which support the idea of an environmental Kuznets curve.
